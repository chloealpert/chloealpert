								<p> There is a barrier to entry for having a well-designed personal custom website that doesn't rely on a blogging or externally owned platofrm. Magnifi.me creates custom parallax websites for personal and business use that are completely custom are delivered in three days or less,  and start at $150. Our goal is to provide excellent, and professional design at an affordable price and an efficient speed. <br> </br>

								 The business model was inspired by Berkeley-based startup SpoonRocket, which is able to deliever good quality meals in under 10 minutes for $6.  This speed and efficiency is due to a structured and limited option set (there are two dishes to choose from) Magnifi.me gives clients a limited set of layout and service options (four) and they simply fill in the copy and resources they want in our order forms, and our designers put that information into the template structure, and send all of the original files to the client.</p>
