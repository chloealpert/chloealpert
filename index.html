					<h2>About</h2>
					<img style="float:left;padding-right:20px;" src="images/chloe.png" width="100px" height="auto"/>
					<p>I was born in the US, educated in England, and am now based in San Francisco, CA where I am currently focused on entrepreneurship and early-stage startups. I specialise in e-commerce and web-based consumer proudcts in brand, strategy, and product marketing.  

						<br></br>I am the founder & CEO of <a href="www.teamanco.com">Teaman & Company</a> and we are the colored gemstone company.  We’re the jeweler to the millennial generation, and we’re changing the way people buy luxury jewelry online. We are the destination for colored gemstone engagement rings & jewelry, and we’re giving our customers access to incredible jewelry and service that they have never seen before.

					<br></br>

					I started my first company when I was 12 years old, opened two stores, and have had a passion for business and problem-solving my entire life. I find the challenge of building, solving, and optimising a system fascinating.

					I am very design oriented, and my skillset includes the Full Adobe CS Suite (expert level), HTML5/CSS3, Liquid, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, jQuery and UX/UI expertise.  My professional experiences span across a variety of fields, and whilst I am currently focused on my startup, I am always looking for new projects and entrepreneurial endeavours.  I'm also very passionate about issues for women in technology, and always keen to speak and participate in relevant events. I'm readily available to travel to anywhere in the world. Please contact me if you're interested in working with me!

								<p> There is a barrier to entry for having a well-designed personal custom website that doesn't rely on a blogging or externally owned platofrm. Magnifi.me creates custom parallax websites for personal and business use that are completely custom are delivered in three days or less,  and start at $150. Our goal is to provide excellent, and professional design at an affordable price and an efficient speed. <br> </br>

								 The business model was inspired by Berkeley-based startup SpoonRocket, which is able to deliever good quality meals in under 10 minutes for $6.  This speed and efficiency is due to a structured and limited option set (there are two dishes to choose from) Magnifi.me gives clients a limited set of layout and service options (four) and they simply fill in the copy and resources they want in our order forms, and our designers put that information into the template structure, and send all of the original files to the client.</p>
							<img src="images/p2a.png" width="90%">	
							<p> Clients can choose from a series of stock image backgrounds for their title page, or they can provide their own images.  Clients are responsible for purchasing their own hosting and domain, but Magnifi.me does offer an assistance serivce to help clients set up their site.</p>
